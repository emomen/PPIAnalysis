# PPIAnalysis
This is a program that predicts the edges in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the yeast species *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The program then validates the prediction results against data from the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets(BioGRID). Datasets are not included in this repository.
